Java + JS MineSweeper
===========================

This is minesweeper game (from Windows) for Java 6 and later. Logic and UI of game is implemented on JS but on Java platform (using Mozilla Rhino).
As you know JDK 6 has scripting API (JSR223) and Rhino included, then this project needs no additional libs to run JavaScript.

There is another project which brings MineSweeper to JS + HTML on <a href='https://github.com/ales-vilchytski/MineSweeper'>github</a>.
