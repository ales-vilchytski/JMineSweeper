Java + JS MineSweeper
===========================

This is minesweeper game (from Windows) for Java 6 and later. Logic and UI of game is implemented on JS but on Java platform (using Mozilla Rhino).
As you know JDK 6 has scripting API (JSR223) and Rhino included, then this project needs no additional libs to run JavaScript.

Project uses ant + ivy and JUnit, then for full evaluation you need to load them. But game's classes can be built without any external lib.

P.S. There is another project which brings MineSweeper to JS + HTML on <a href='https://github.com/ales-vilchytski/MineSweeper'>github</a>.
