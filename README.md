Java + JS MineSweeper
===========================

This is version of minesweeper game (from Windows) for Java 6 and later. Logic and UI of game is implemented on JS but on Java platform using Mozilla Rhino.
As you know JDK 6 has scripting API and Rhino included, then this project needs no additional libs to run JavaScript.
