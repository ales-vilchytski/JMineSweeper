Java + JS MineSweeper
===========================

This is minesweeper game (from Windows) for Java 6 and later. Logic and UI of game is implemented on JS but on Java platform (using Mozilla Rhino through JSR223).
To run JSR223 JavaScript engine used class from another project: <a href='https://github.com/ales-vilchytski/JSExecutor'>JSExecutor</a>

Project uses ant + ivy and JSExecutor of mine. Then, for full evaluation you need to load them.

P.S. There is another project which brings MineSweeper to JS + HTML on <a href='https://github.com/ales-vilchytski/MineSweeper'>github</a>.
